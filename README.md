# DataSciencePortfolio
A collection of data science projects to demonstrate skill sets, knowledge, and what I find fascinating!

## Contents

## In Progress
- **bikeshare-case-study** analyzes how to maximize annual membership conversion rate given Divvy's historical trip data.
  - _Skills Demonstrated_: ETL on Google Cloud Platform, Querying with SQL, Exploratory Data Analysis with Python and Apache Spark, Data Visualization with Tableau
- **neural-network-compression** trains a reference deep neural network to classify handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The reference neural network is then compressed with UC Merced's LC algorithm, optimizing the performance-to-compression ratio.
  - _Skills Demonstrated_: Machine Learning with PyTorch (Model Training, Evaluation, Parameter Tuning), Android Development with Kotlin and TensorFlow Lite
