# Business Task

Divvy Bikes (by Lyft) is a bikeshare company based in Chicago that labels its customers as either _casual riders_ or _annual members_. Divvy's marketing analytics team decide to increase profits by running an ad campaign trying to convert casual riders into annual members. Therefore, we investigate how casual riders are different from annual members given the last 24 months of customer trip data.
